description: 'An initial consultation, free of charge, is scheduled to get an idea of what it is you would like to have done. We can discuss the overall concept of your landscape and identify the areas you would like to see better utilized. If a full plan is needed or desired, we can work with you to create a set of working plans for your landscape. If you decide to have New Leaf install the project, the design fee will typically be waived. All of our projects are installed with attention to detail and customer satisfaction in mind. Even the smallest project is important to us. '
